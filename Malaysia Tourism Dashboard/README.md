## How to Use This Dashboard
The dashboard is designed for exploration. Use the different tabs to switch between the Overview and Trends dashboards. You can use the filters to narrow down the data by country or time period. Most charts are interactive, so clicking on a data point will cross-filter the rest of the dashboard, allowing you to drill down into the details.
