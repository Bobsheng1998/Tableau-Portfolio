## Welcome to My Tableau Portfolio
This repository showcases my data visualisation and analysis projects, created using Tableau. Each project features an interactive dashboard designed to explore complex datasets, uncover key insights, and tell compelling data stories.

The projects within this portfolio demonstrate my ability to:

* Transform raw data into clear and meaningful visualisations.
* Design and build interactive dashboards that are easy to navigate.
* Identify and communicate key insights from data.
* Structure a data narrative around a central theme.
* Feel free to explore the dashboards directly using the links below or dive into the individual project folders to learn more about the data and the analysis.
