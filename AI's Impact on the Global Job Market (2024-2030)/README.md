# AI's Impact on the Global Job Market (2024-2030)
This project features an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyse and visualise the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence on the global job market. It provides a comprehensive overview of job trends, identifies key areas of risk and opportunity, and explores the characteristics of jobs that are most resilient to automation.

## Dashboards
The analysis is presented across two distinct, interactive dashboards:
### 1. Job Market Overview
This dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of the changing job landscape, helping users quickly understand the net impact of AI. Its key features include:

* KPIs: At-a-glance metrics for total job openings in 2024 and 2030, the net change, and the projected growth rate.

* Projected Growth by Industry: A bar chart visualising the net change in jobs across different industries, highlighting winners and losers.

* Global Impact Map: A choropleth map showing the projected job changes by country.

* Top 10 Growing & Declining Jobs: A clear, side-by-side view of the specific job titles most affected by AI.

### 2. Risk & Opportunity Deep Dive
This dashboard offers a granular view of the factors correlated with AI's impact, allowing users to explore the underlying relationships. Its key features include:

* Automation Risk vs. Median Salary: A scatter plot that explores the complex relationship between a job's automation risk and its salary.

* AI Impact by Education Level: A breakdown of how AI's impact is distributed across different required education levels.

* Remote Work & Automation: An analysis comparing the potential for remote work with a job's vulnerability to AI.

* Detailed Job Data Table: A filterable table for exploring the raw data behind the visualisations.

## Key Insights
### 1. Industry and Global Shifts
The job market's growth is concentrated in specific sectors and geographic regions. Industries like IT, Healthcare, and Finance are poised for significant growth, while others like Transportation face declines. The data also reveals a potential geographic divide, with technologically advanced economies like the USA and Canada seeing job growth while others may lag.

### 2. The Human Skills Premium
A clear pattern emerges: jobs projected to grow demand skills that are difficult for AI to replicate. Roles centred on creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and strategic advisory (e.g., educational psychologist, careers information officer) are thriving. Conversely, roles with predictable or data-driven tasks (e.g., planning surveyor, geochemist) are most vulnerable.

### 3. The Risk-Reward Paradox
Surprisingly, a high salary does not guarantee safety from automation. Many high-paying jobs show a high automation risk, suggesting that AI is automating specific tasks within complex professions rather than replacing entire roles. Professionals must adapt by focusing on the strategic, human-centric aspects of their work.

### 4. Remote Work is Not an Escape Route
The ability to work remotely has almost no correlation with a job's vulnerability to AI. The data shows that high-risk and low-risk jobs have a nearly identical likelihood of being remote. The key factor for resilience is the nature of the work's tasks, not the location where it's performed.

## How to Use This Dashboard
The dashboard is designed for exploration. Use the global filters for Industry, Location, and Required Education to narrow your search. Additionally, most charts are interactive - click on a data point (like an industry bar or a country on the map) to cross-filter the entire dashboard and drill down into the details.
